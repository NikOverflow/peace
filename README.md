### Why not python or javascript?

- Because I want to try out a high-performance, efficient compiled language. 
- If you want a bancho written in python, please use gulag, it's good.

### Why not C++?

- Because Rust is the best choice for near C++ performance, but more modern.

### Reasons to choose Rust:

1. **High performance and efficiency**

    No garbage collection, Rust's performance is very close to C++, and its memory footprint is low.

2. **Modernization**

    Rust is a modern compiled language with an elegant syntax.

3. **Package Management**

    Cargo, just like npm or pip, is convenient and has many packages available.
 
4. **Security**

    Memory Safety: No worry about memory leaks and segment errors; 
    
    Thread-safe: no data contention.

5. **Asynchronous Support**

    It is very easy and elegant to write asynchronous code in Rust, supporting very high concurrency.

6. **Cross-compilation**

    Rust is very easy to cross-compile. After a simple configuration, you can compile Rust programs for linux platforms on Windows.

7. **Documentation**

    Clear and complete language documentation
